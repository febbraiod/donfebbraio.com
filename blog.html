    <h4>1.8.16</h4>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really like my gem.  I feel fairly proud of it.  I don’t know if it's all that great in the grand scheme of things, but I put a lot of hours into it. I’m sure the code could be better and cleaner. But it works and it works exactly how I envisioned it. That said, the project did not get off to a good start. The holidays, which for various reasons lasted well into this week, felt like a endurance contest that consisted of jumping between family and friends in different states (both geographic and mental) and dodging social gatherings whenever possible in order to get my final projects done. After dragging myself through an oddly sweltering December and a freezing start to January, I finally got to sit down and watch my football games and look forward to a (hopefully quieter) new year.  I look back on my notes for this CLI gem project and at the very top of the page I see:</p>

    <h5>FUCKING JETS!!!!</h5>

    <p>I’m sure I could have written a whole lot of worse things that evening, but instead I got back to work, and I’m glad I did.  I now have my first (somewhat?) useful program. And a new website I made almost by accident just so I could have something to break the monotony!</p>

    <p>This is actually my first blog post. As the title suggests, I'm required to submit a blog post (and a video) detailing my experience in building this gem. I will include the video with this post. As for the blog I thought it might be fun to recreate the posts I might have blogged from my notes over the course of the week. I actually intend to do a lot of this backward blogging in the future to kind of give myself a point of reference from where I started with this coding adventure.</p>

    <p>Anything after the following video is recreated from my notes and not actually a present day blog post proper.</p>

    <p>To sum up the process and project all I can say is the process was challenging and it took much longer than I expected, but the project itself was interesting and totally worth it. One thing I learned is I like working on more than one project at a time; switching keeps each of them fresh and fun. When I work on only one I think I work less hours total, but I do worry that for the purposes of having a job this might not be the best way to work. I guess I'll find out.</p>

    <h3>I'll Drink to That</h3>
    <h4>1.7.16</h4>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Need a break from the gem so I'm working on coding up my personal site so I can post my blog stuff for the assessment.</p>

    <p>Finished a dynamic layout for home page, and designed a blog page but didn't code it.</p>

    <p>Switched projects after lunch and am trying to straighten out my gem for publishing.</p>
  
    <p>Gemspec file was tricky and I forgot to gem build (gem build sommeligem.gemspec), but Vincent from Learn helped out and...</p>


    <p>IT’S WORKING!</p>

    <p>Just need to clean up a few bugs and do my video and blog posts.</p>


    <h3>Wine with Food and Food with Wine</h3>
    <h4>1.6.16</h4>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worked out my hashes. Food => Wine and Wine => Food had to be done seperately because simply reversing the info wouldn't work for the context of the CLI.  I also got my #wine_to_food pairing method working.</p>


    <h3>Just another day in the life of a budding <br>(if slightly older) developer</h3>
    <h4>1.5.16</h4>
    
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not much going on today but building the CLI for my gem, need to build pairing method next.</p>

    <p>One cool thought: 
    The question isn’t: what can I program? The question is: what can’t I program? &trade;</p>

    <p>For the hell of it I put that into google and I thought the result was funny. I wonder if it's intentional:"</p>

    <img src="images/googlescreenshot.png" alt="What can't I program doesn't match an documents.">


    <h3>Scrape this!</h3>
    <h4>1.4.16</h4>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I worked about 8 hours today but it felt like a lot longer:</p>

    <p>I started by setting up to screen capture my coding for this gem. I found that naming this thing is harder than I thought, and I can't start until I set up a repo with the name. I think Im leaning toward “sommeligem”</p>

    <p>Ok fine "sommeligem" it is. It definitely says what the thing is supposed to do, but I fear that it will read like "smelly-gem" by some. Meh. Set up repo and submitted.</p>
    
    <p>I started my coding video but I ran into problems with scraping. I think it’s because of something called “aria”.  I just can't get the right css selectors.  Tried to do a bunch of research but still fighting it.</p>

    <p>After speaking with someone from Learn, it turned out they couldn’t scrape that site either. It looked to both of us as if the data wasn't actually on the page. Apparently I have to start over ☹.</p>

    <p> Success! I found another site that will serve! Unfortunately, I will have to change some of the original outline for my gem as this site has different info and only has 1 available year of top 100s.</p>

    <p>Second coding video went much better</p>

    <p>I did some good coding in my bathtub today. <i>Do I really want to reveal this? ...too late.</i> It popped into my head to call my portfolio/blog “Design. Program. Rinse. Repeat.”</p>

    <p>I took a little bit of time to draw up an artboard for the home page of my personal website. I know this is probably a distraction but I really feel the need to strike while the iron is hot sometimes. And I really want something that looks very simple anyway.</p>

    <p>Got back to scraping for CLI gem project (wine) of which there seems to be a whole lot.</p>
    
    <p>Around 7pm I finished my scraper class (well, finished in terms of function but my code is a little messy). I had a rough time with one of the categories because my selector was picking up the span I wanted but also the span after it, and screwing up my iterating. It took me forever to figure out that I wanted “:first-child” but it rocked when I finally got it to work. Hash is built correctly and now I have to use it to build my CLI.</p>

    <p>Today felt like a longer day than it was but it was worth it.</p>


    <h3>I'll take some gems with my Ruby</h3>
    <h4>1.3.16</h4>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I spent a couple hours after the game reading about gems and trying to figure out what kind of gem I want to build. I looked at Avi’s gem ('now-playing') while drinking a glass of wine, and I think I’m going to go with something similar but regarding wine rather than movies. Came up with the following so far:</p>

    <p>Titles: TopWinesGem or SomGem
    <p>It scrapes the Wine Spectator (http://2015.top100.winespectator.com) site for the info needed to perform the following:</p>
    <p>It displays all the different wines on the list in order from 1-100.</p>
    <p>It isolates the name from the grape.</p>
    <p>The user can choose more info on any of the wines 1–100 (be careful some years there are ties..you will have to be clear about...   64.  Rank: 64,  65. Rank: 64 ...when it comes to user input.)</p>
    <p>Choosing a wine will provide a desciption, price, rating and vintage. Alternatively the user can choose the pairing option in which they can pare down the list by a food group.  Say if
    they choose "red meat" or "beef" the list will redisplay with the wines that match the varietal I associate it with.</p>
    <p>BONUS:  Can they then select from that pared down list for details? Also, hypothetically, we could add the list for different years.(might be able to do this simply by changing the year in the URL.)</p>
    <p>Note to self => Draw out a Hash?, array? hashes? that will help something like:</p>
    <p>[{:rank => 2, :name => "Black Box", :varietal => "Red Blend" :details => [price, rating, vintage]},{}]</p>
